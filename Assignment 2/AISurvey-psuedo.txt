#Used IO packages, some of which could be like java.io.BufferedWriter / java.io.FileWriter /java.io.PrintStream / java.util.*#

#Create a separate 2d array string of questions[][], storing the answer in [i] [1] after getting user input for each question. [i][0] held the question itself.#

#Iterate over questions[][] with a for loop, setting questions[i][1] to the response from:# 
String (response) = scanner.nextLine();

#Make switch/case schema to evaluate the value of the responses. Whichever case it was, it incremented a corresponding party int (4, one int per each party).#
int Dem
if question == true{
Dem++
}

#Using a series of if else statements, compare the values of each of the 4 party ints to each other.

#Whichever partyname int was the highest, write  out to (partyname).txt the contents of the array using BufferedWriter and the name of the file with FileWriter. Then prompt the user to input what their actual party was, which can be written out to the same file.#

#Arrays.deepToString is an easy way to change that 2d array to a String so that it can be used with the write function.#

#Trying to implement error catching logic:
Print the first question,
if the answer is not valid:
do not print the next question + answer, repeat the question

#save each set of responses in its own text file. Make a file and file writer for each party. whichever party has the highest score will have the responses saved in that text file.#
